        Â I contributed to enhancing device security by creating a backend API
        using FastAPI and Python. This API empowered the security team to
        efficiently manage vulnerable assets. I was involved in the entire
        development lifecycle, encompassing backend, frontend, and database
        migrations to deliver a comprehensive solution within my internship. To
        protect sensitive backend data, I implemented robust authentication and
        authorization mechanisms utilizing JWTs and Okta. Furthermore, I
        streamlined the deployment process by automating builds and deploys,
        enabling the security team to access real-time information on company
        devices and vulnerabilities. Currently, I am developing a Next.js
        frontend and assisting in establishing the infrastructure to complete
        the project.

        Built reusable UI components in React Native and TypeScript, ensuring
        consistency across the mobile and web applications. I also streamlined
        data retrieval and caching using GraphQL and Apollo, improving app
        performance. Also created bug fixes and manage database migrations in
        Django. Furthermore, I improved monitoring and alerting systems with
        Terraform and Datadog. My work on AWS S3 buckets led to a significant
        storage cost reduction by deleting unused data (nearly 9 TB!).

        I modernized their PHP data acces layer (5.3 to 8.1) for enhanced
        security and PostgreSQL compatibility. I created integration tests
        (PHPUnit) and documented testing procedures for future engineers. I also
        automated testing with bash scripts, streamlining the process and
        ensuring data consistency. This project improved data security and
        established a robust testing framework.
